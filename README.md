# stock-trading-with-ML

Python program that trades the SP500 index on the hourly charts. Used OANDA'S fxpractice account to get data and make trades. Used Machine Learning and Scikit-Learn library to train models and make predictions of future price movements. Trained the models on over 11 000 data points and used MLP's (multi-layer perceptrons) as my machine learning algorithm. Received a result of 94% from back-testing. The program is currently being forward tested
